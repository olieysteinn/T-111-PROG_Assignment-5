# 1. The user inputs the length of the sequence
# 2. Run a for loop with the sequence length and add up to the first three numbers in the sequence into variables
# 3. Print out the three numbers
# 4. Put the sum of the three numbers into a variable
# 5. Set the second number as the first, the third as the second and the sum as the third
# 6. Repeat steps 3 - 5 until the secuence length has been reached
